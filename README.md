## Flower Listing (RESTful React Project)

Please use `npm install` to install all dependencies, and `npm start` to start the project.

This is a simple React project that uses useReducer for managing state. I have used FileSaver library for saving files from client side. Idea was to load user posts on the dashboard, but Facebook couldn't verify permissions on the app in time given as deadline for this task, so what remained from original idea is Facebook authentication.
